Numerical simulation of the radiative transfer at the epoch of reionization

This repository is a project that is a part of my Master 2 of Astrophysics at Strasbourg astronomical observatory.
The content of this project is based on a paper published by Dominique Aubert and Romain Teyssier : A radiative transfer scheme for cosmological reionization based on a local Eddington tensor. (arXiv:0709.1544)

Work in progress (:
